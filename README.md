Welcome to your first real project.

In this project, we have some sales data and you'll fill in a bunch of functions to return interesting slices of and stats over that data. The app skeleton is filled out for you and all of the functions are defined - you just have to fill them out.

The file you'll be editing is called app.js and it lives in the cli-client/ folder.

You can run it by CDing into the cli-client/ folder and typing node app.js.
