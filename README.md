Welcome to your first real project.

In this project, we have some sales data and you'll fill in a bunch of functions to return interesting slices of and stats over that data. The app skeleton is filled out for you and all of the functions are defined - you just have to fill them out.

The file you'll be editing is called app.js. To run it, type node app.js. It's a command line application which accepts commands and runs the appropriate function to print out data (the ones you'll be writing). Type 'help' to get a list of the commands.
